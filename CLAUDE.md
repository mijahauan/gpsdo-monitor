# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this project is

**gpsdo-monitor** is a health monitor, mDNS advertiser, and
configurator for [Leo Bodnar](http://www.leobodnar.com/) GPS-disciplined
clock sources (LBE-1420 / LBE-1421 / LBE-1423 / LBE-Mini).

Its primary consumer is [`hf-timestd`](https://github.com/mijahauan/hf-timestd)'s
authority manager: gpsdo-monitor publishes an **actively probed A-level**
signal that closes the "GPSDO is *probably* still disciplining the
RX888 ADC" gap. The daemon also stands alone — it emits a simple file
plus mDNS contract that any consumer can read.

Part of the HamSCI sigmond suite — see `/opt/git/sigmond/sigmond/CLAUDE.md`
(orchestrator) and `/opt/git/sigmond/CLAUDE.md` (umbrella) for
cross-repo context.

## Authors

- Michael Hauan (AC0G, GitHub: mijahauan)
- Repo: https://github.com/mijahauan/gpsdo-monitor
- Driver bytes ported from [`bvernoux/lbe-142x`](https://github.com/bvernoux/lbe-142x)
  (LBE-1420 / Mini code paths — see README for live-hardware coverage).

## Commands

```bash
# Development — uv canonical
uv sync --extra dev
uv run pytest tests/

# Production install (uses sigmond's shared _ensure_uv helper)
sudo ./install.sh

# CLI
gpsdo-monitor detect           # enumerate attached Leo Bodnar HIDs
gpsdo-monitor status           # one-shot JSON dump per device
gpsdo-monitor serve            # long-lived probe daemon (systemd)
gpsdo-monitor tui              # Textual live-view TUI ([tui] extra)
gpsdo-monitor config <...>     # manual debugging only; prefer `smd gpsdo config`
```

The canonical operator surface for configuration is **`smd gpsdo
config`** (in the sigmond orchestrator). The `gpsdo-monitor config`
subcommand is a placeholder for manual debugging.

## What it does (and doesn't)

The lifecycle is **Detect → Probe → Publish → Advertise → Advise**:

1. **Detect** attached Leo Bodnar USB HIDs (VID `0x1DD2`, four known
   PIDs). Refuses to guess when multiple devices are attached without
   a declared serial.
2. **Probe** health at 10 s cadence — PLL lock, GPS fix (from NMEA on
   1421/1423 or NAV-PVT on Mini), antenna status, satellites used,
   fix age, output frequencies, 1 PPS presence, Mini signal-loss
   count.
3. **Publish** per-device state atomically to `/run/gpsdo/<serial>.json`
   (schema v1) plus an aggregate `/run/gpsdo/index.json` for TUI
   consumption.
4. **Advertise** over mDNS as `_gpsdo._tcp` so remote consumers
   (splitter-fed topologies) can read health without SSH.
5. **Advise** — emits `a_level_hint` (`A1` / `A0`) with a
   human-readable reason; on the Mini, parses UBX-MON-VER to report
   u-blox firmware and flag outdated PROTVER.

It is **not**:

- A metrology reference. PPS stability numbers are OS-millisecond
  bound (via `TIOCMIWAIT` on the CDC DCD line) and only indicate
  liveness + gross stability. Every `pps_study` block carries that
  warning verbatim in its `note` field.
- A system-clock disciplinarian. Chrony does that.
- A vendor reverse-engineering project. It stays within the
  feature-report layouts documented by lbe-142x; no undocumented
  HID opcodes.

## Hardware support matrix

| Feature            | LBE-1420 | LBE-1421 | LBE-1423 | LBE-Mini |
|--------------------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|
| HID status parse   | ✓        | ✓        | ✓        | ✓        |
| NMEA fix / sats    | —        | ✓ CDC    | ✓ CDC    | ✓ NAV-PVT |
| 1 PPS edge capture | —        | ✓ DCD    | ✓ DCD    | —        |
| Firmware advisory  | —        | —        | —        | ✓ MON-VER |
| Live-hardware coverage | ported (not validated) | ✓ | ported (not validated) | ported (not validated) |

The LBE-1421 is the actively-validated path. The other three drivers
are byte-level-tested against captures from `bvernoux/lbe-142x` but
have not been exercised against live hardware here.

## File / mDNS contract for consumers

- **Per-device state:** `/run/gpsdo/<serial>.json` (schema v1, written
  atomically; see `schema.py`).
- **Aggregate:** `/run/gpsdo/index.json`.
- **mDNS service:** `_gpsdo._tcp`, payload pointers to the same JSON
  shape so remote consumers can read without SSH.

`hf-timestd`'s authority manager subscribes to this contract. New
consumers should read schema.py rather than re-deriving the field
layout.

## Production paths

- Runtime state: `/run/gpsdo/<serial>.json`, `/run/gpsdo/index.json`
- Venv: `/opt/gpsdo-monitor/venv`
- Source: `/opt/git/sigmond/gpsdo-monitor` (editable install)
- Systemd unit: `gpsdo-monitor.service` (via sigmond catalog + `smd
  install gpsdo-monitor`)
- udev rules: shipped under `deploy/` so the HID is readable without
  root once installed.

## Dependencies

- `hidapi>=0.14` — HID feature-report I/O.
- `zeroconf>=0.131` — mDNS service registration.
- `pyserial>=3.5` — CDC stream for NMEA (1421/1423) and DCD-line PPS.
- Optional `[tui]` extra: `textual` (for the live-view TUI).

This is a Python-only daemon: stdlib-first style, with the three
hardware-facing libraries above as the only required deps.
